## Features and Benefits

### Data binding
Data binding works out of the box for all the [popular data](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/carousel-view/populating-data?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=maui-carousel-github-samples) sources. Every aspect of the Carousel control has been designed with the MVVM pattern in mind.

### Custom templates
The .NET MAUI Carousel control accepts templates to change the look of its items.

### On-demand loading
On-demand loading enables users to load a subset of data in the .NET MAUI Carousel control and to [load more](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/carousel-view/loadmore?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=maui-carousel-github-samples) items when needed. It helps users increase initial loading performance when populating a huge number of items.

### Virtualization
The .NET MAUI Carousel control has been [virtualized](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/carousel-view/UIVirtualization?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=maui-carousel-github-samples) to improve loading performance and reduce the app’s memory.
